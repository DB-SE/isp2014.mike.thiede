In this task, variability is provided by FeatureHouse, an FOP extension of Java. There are 10 features implemented, which can be selected/unselected as needed. FeatureIDE takes care of dependencies between features.

Selectable features are:
* indexOf
* ordinalIndexOf
* indexOfIgnoreCase
* indexOfAny
* stripToNull
* stripStart
* stripEnd
* left
* mid
* right

Some other features are just implemented to satisfy dependencies of the listed ones.
