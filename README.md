Product lines implemented by Mike Thiede

NOTE:
Java project for task two uses some code from [Apache Commons Lang](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/).

License of that project can be found [here](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

GUI, command line variability and preprocessor variability are created on my own.

Projects are renamed to contain task number now.
